This website is developed for people to book appoinments with doctors of certain specialization and consult them from any corner of the world.
During this hard time of global pandemic, people feared of going to the hospitals for their acute problems and so remained untreated. There were some who moved back to their home towns, while they were consulting a particular practitioner and so faced difficulties. 
Since everything is now operating remotely, we thought of bringing specialists in direct contact with their patients. Patients can check ratings and feedback and then decide to book a doctor of their choice at minimal cost.

Using our website, patients can book appointments with any doctor of their and can consult them online through video call and can receive a prescription as well.

Since every problem cannot be cured through video calls, we have thought of limiting the specialists. The specialists which we will be providing are :
1. Paediatric : Children have weak immunity and so are prone to diseases. Thus if a paediatric could be available online, it would be really helpful for families. If the problem is minor the paediatric would cure it through a video call and if the problem is major, then he/she can recommend a good hospital. 
2. Dermatologist : Skin problems are again one of those problems that can be cured remotely. By simply answering questions of the dermatologist people can receive their solutions.
3. ENT Specialist
4. Psychiatrist : One of the major problem is our society is that people feel ashamed of consulting a psychiatrist. This could be made easier by just consulting them online as the details would remain completely private between the patient and the doctor.
5. Nutritionist : A healthy diet is a necessity.To build out immunity is eally important. And if a person could a perfect nutrionist without going anywhere, would be very helpful. 
6. General Physiscian : Common cold, headache, fever etc. these are some small problems that do can be solved by consulting a doctor online.
